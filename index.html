                    India.</h2><br>
                <p>For my dissertation project, I delved into an investigation of change management strategies employed by electric vehicle manufacturers in China and India. This research allowed me to explore the dynamic landscape of the electric vehicle industry in these countries, analyzing the approaches adopted by manufacturers to navigate and implement change. I have researched about the current EV industries and the obstacle that they face and the solutions and the change that they make in the fast-paced environment with comparing both EV manufacturers from China and India. Through this journey I have gained valuable insights into the unique challenges and innovative solutions embraced by electric vehicle manufacturers in these influential regions.</p>

                    Application</h2><br>
                <p>The objective of this project is to develop an environmentally friendly sound damping panel tailored for higher frequency applications. Our approach involved utilizing natural fibers from the Camellia sinensis plant (commonly known as the tea plant), fibers from Ananas comosus (pineapple) and E-Glass Fibres for adding strength. By combining these fibers with epoxy resin, we crafted a sinusoidal corrugated structure, sandwiched between flat fiber plates by mould pressing method. This innovative design aims to replace synthetic sound damping plates currently prevalent in the market. In collaboration with my mentor, S. Gokul Kumar, and fellow peers Reavanth. S and Suryaprakash. A, we have successfully patented this eco-friendly panel. Our solution not only contributes to sustainability but also offers an effective alternative to traditional synthetic sound damping materials.</p>

                <h2>Requirement Specification for Water Distribution Network and design for 
                    Firefighting in a Large Ship</h2><br>
                <p>The primary goal of this project is to develop an efficient Water Distribution Network for the Firefighting System on a ship comprising 10 compartments. We adopted a top-down approach, meticulously identifying system requirements and crafting a comprehensive architectural diagram. Engaging in thorough research and consulting experts, I take pride in personally designing the entire system architecture based on the customer requirements.                    To ensure the system's robustness, we employed Fault Tree Analysis, meticulously assessing the failure probability of various scenarios during the feasibility study. This allowed us to align the system's reliability with the specific demands outlined by the customer.
                    Additionally, we utilized Quality Function Deployment (QFD) analysis to precisely understand and align customer requirements with engineering specifications. This process has allowed us to streamline and enhance the system to meet the customer's needs effectively. Our commitment to a detailed and thoughtful design process ensures the Water Distribution Network for the Firefighting System not only meets but exceeds customer expectations.</p>
