                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a Master of Engineering Management graduate from the University of Leicester and a Mechanical Engineering graduate from KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology, I offer a unique blend of engineering knowledge and management expertise. My academic background has equipped me with core competencies in lean manufacturing, systems engineering, project planning, and cost optimization—reinforced through hands-on experience with tools like SEER for project estimation and Autodesk Fusion 360 for 3D modelling and prototyping.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my academic journey, I led and contributed to impactful projects, including the UKSEDS In-Orbit Servicing and Manufacturing Competition, where our team secured 3rd place across the UK in June 2025 for designing sustainable space-based solutions using additive manufacturing. I also applied 3D printing techniques in several independent projects, designing functional and ergonomic tools and components.
My engineering foundation is supported by practical industry exposure—from coordinating procurement and machinery upgrades as a Project Engineer Apprentice at KPM Fab, to gaining hands-on mechanical servicing experience during internships with Euregaa Motors and South India Motors. 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I explored sustainable materials through a final-year academic project that involved designing a natural fiber-based acoustic panel, deepening my understanding of materials engineering—even though the patent application did not proceed.
Currently, I am employed as a Warehouse Operative at Royal Mail, where I’ve strengthened my skills in operations, logistics, teamwork, and adaptability in a high-volume, automated environment.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With strong communication, problem-solving, and leadership abilities, I’m passionate about contributing to engineering projects that drive innovation, sustainability, and operational excellence. I’m eager to apply my knowledge, continue learning, and make a meaningful impact in the engineering and technology sector.

                <p>Executed a groundbreaking project where innovation meets sustainability in the realm of sound damping technology. Our mission was to engineer an environmentally friendly sound damping panel tailored for higher frequency applications, revolutionizing the industry with a unique approach. By harnessing the natural fibers, we crafted a uni-directional corrugated panel structure embedded within epoxy resin. The plates developed in corrugated shape and molded through mold pressing method. In collaboration with esteemed mentor Gokul Kumar. S and dedicated peers Reavanth. S and Suryaprakash. A, we successfully patented this eco-friendly panel, marking a significant milestone in sustainable sound damping solutions.<br>
                <p2>Highlights:</p2>
                <ul>
                    <li> The panel is made with Camellia sinensis (tea plant) and Ananas comosus (pineapple), added along with E-Glass Fibres to increase strength.</li>
                    <li>The panel was ingeniously designed featuring a sinusoidal corrugatedpattern sandwiched betweenflat fiber plates.</li>
