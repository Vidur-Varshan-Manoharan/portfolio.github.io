With conducting rigorous analysis it enabled us to enhance the system's reliability in alignment with customer demands.  Our commitment to a detailed and thoughtful design process we have verified and validated the design to ensures the Water Distribution Network for the Firefighting System meets customer expectations.<br>
                <p2>Highlights:</p2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>To ensure the system's resilience, we conducted a comprehensive Fault Tree Analysis to assess failure probabilities across various scenarios during the feasibility study.</li>
                    <li>we utilized Quality Function Deployment (QFD) analysis to precisely understand and align customer requirements with engineering specifications.</li>
